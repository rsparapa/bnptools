Changes and New Features in 1.6 (2023-01-10):
	* conditional sampling for bivariate NFT

Changes and New Features in 1.5 (2023-01-06):
        * streamlining the interface to nft2/nft/tsvs2/tsvs

	* for code maintainability, nft is just a wrapper of nft2
	  (and predict.nft is just a wrapper of predict.nft2)

	* for non-FPD scenarios, calculate lower/upper just like FPD

	* harden bMM for P=1 

Changes and New Features in 1.4 (2022-08-25):
	* New option: mask unstable sd(.) estimates to calculate soffset

	* Use hardened DPM LIO variance prior setting

	* Return both the LPML and the CPO

	* add bMM (a la bartModelMatrix) to compute dummies/etc.

        * predict produces draws from the predictive distribution of log t
	  to facilitate C index calculations

	* predict.aftree provided for producing survival/pdf/hazard
	  function estimates (or their Friedman's partial dependence 
          estimates if requested) for AFT BART like predict.nft does 
	  for NFT BART
          also draws from the predictive distribution of log t (as above)
	
	* experimental support for differing X matrices for f and sd
	  see nft2 function

	* Thompson Sampling Variable Selection functions
	  tsvs for the same X matrix and tsvs2 for two different matrices

	* new function bMM() to replace the deprecated bartModelMatrix()

	* new function Cindex() to compute Harrell's C-index

Changes and New Features in 1.3 (2022-03-26):
	* Trap error code returned from rcat

Changes and New Features in 1.2 (2022-02-01):
	* Allow DPM LIO parameters to be altered for
	  debugging/sensitivity analysis 

	* Return inital AFT fit

Changes and New Features in 1.1 (2021-12-17):
	* Fix documentation bug 

Changes and New Features in 1.0 (2021-12-16):
	* First release after almost 3 years of testing
