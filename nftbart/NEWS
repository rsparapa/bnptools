Changes and New Features in 1.4 (2022-07-26):
	* New option: mask unstable s(.) estimates to calculate soffset

	* Use hardened DPM LIO variance prior setting

	* Return both the LPML and the CPO

	* add bMM (a la bartModelMatrix) to compute dummies/etc.

        * predict produces draws from the predictive distribution of log t
	  to facilitate C index calculations

	* predict.aftree now provided for producing survival/hazard
	  function estimates (or their Friedman's partial dependence 
          estimates if requested) for AFT BART like predict.nft does 
	  for NFT BART
          also draws from the predictive distribution of log t (as above)
	
	* experimental support for differing X matrices for f and s
	  see nft2 function

	* Thompson Sampling Variable Selection functions
	  tsvs for the same X matrix and tsvs2 for two different matrices

Changes and New Features in 1.3 (2022-03-26):
	* Trap error code returned from rcat

Changes and New Features in 1.2 (2022-02-01):
	* Allow DPM LIO parameters to be altered for
	  debugging/sensitivity analysis 

	* Return inital AFT fit

Changes and New Features in 1.1 (2021-12-17):
	* Fix documentation bug 

Changes and New Features in 1.0 (2021-12-16):
	* First release after almost 3 years of testing
