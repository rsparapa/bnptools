Here we give a brief overview of the C++ source code in the src directory.

DPMLIOmutau.h  For the DPM LIO method of Shi and Martens et al. 2018
DPMLIOneal8.h  Algorithm 8 for non-conjugate DPM draws from Neal 2000
ambrt.h	       The "ambrt" class inherited from "mbrt"
brt.h	       The "sinfo" class for sufficient statistics and the
	       "brt" virtual class for generic BART
brtfuns.h      These helper functions are not members of the "brt"
	       class yet provide necessary cross-class operations
cnft2.h	       The "cnft2" function for NFT BART that has two different 
	       X matrices: "xftrain" for mu(xftrain) and "xstrain" for 
	       sd(xstrain)
cprnft2.h      The "cprnft2" function for predictions from mu(xftrain) and 
	       sd(xstrain) when "xftrain" and "xstrain" are strings
cpsambrt_predict2.h      
	       The "cpsambrt_predict2" function for predictions from 
	       mu(xftrain) and sd(xstrain) when "xftrain" and "xstrain" 
	       are available in RAM via XPtr
dinfo.h	       The "dinfo" class for data
getpred.h      Definition of the "getpred" function for tree predictions
init.c	       Defines the C++ functions that can be called and the
	       number of arguments that they take
mbrt.h	       The "mbrt" class for additive tree means inherited from "brt"
nftbart.cpp    The only C++ source file to be compiled/linked
psbrt.h	       The "psbrt" class for inherited from "sbrt"
rn.h	       Setup the pseudo-random number generator class
sbrt.h	       The "sbrt" class for product tree variance inherited from "brt"
tree.h	       Defines the "tree" class
treefuns.h     These helper functions are not members of the "tree"
	       class yet provide necessary cross-class operations
